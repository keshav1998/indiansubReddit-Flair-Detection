Sex is a sinful and dirty necessity for men in India as it was in medieval age in Europe to Christians. So, even in 21st century there is no sex education in Indian education system. Sex is taboo. We cannot respect sex and so we cannot respect women in sexual roles because women should not have sexual desire. We can respect women only after stripping them of their sexuality. Then she becomes a Devi. Otherwise she is a Randi.\\n\\nBecause we give respect only to women in asexual roles, we disrespect women who wear short dress, or go out at night or drink or smoke or have premarital sex. Such women are not perceived to have any respect or dignity. They are seen to have dishonoured themselves. This is why we tend to see them as available *maal* and/or punishable offenders.

If one accepts a woman as a woman, not as a mother or sister or wife, he has to accept her individuality. Individuality includes her sexuality. That is a very big risk for an Indian man.

No one considered that women might be more hesitant in india to go on tinder dates than a country in which women have already had a sexual revolution. No one said well maybe Tinder is just a reflection of my irl success with women.

I read an awesome explanation from u/nonsequitrist just 2 days ago on r/worldnews in a thread about the Unnao rape victim regarding this:\\n\\n> This is a critical clue about a major, other factor. Those of us from the West, and those acculturated to the US in particular, have a particular value system that enshrines the value of the individual. This orientation is explicit in many laws and conceptions of individual rights. It is also central in many ongoing political tensions in Western societies -- the quandaries that arise when individual rights conflict with community needs.\\n\\n> This championing of the status of the individual is not a fundamental aspect of human thought. Other societies have different conceptions of the relationship of the individual to larger social structures. In India much of the value and status attached to human life is centered on the family.\\n\\n> The implications of this difference are extensive. Within the family structure, members generally have much higher value and status than outsiders (obviously in a complex society there are numberless exceptions and complexities involved in such generalizations). Outside of a family structure, individuals cannot derive value and status from that family unit, and therefore have less value and status.\\n\\n> The results of this value system can be seen in legal enforcement and judicial matters, in social norms and soft-power institutions. One effect is the cheapening of life to those who don't share a family bond with the life in question.\\n\\n> For Westerners this can seem alien and profoundly unjust. I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with any position that one value-system is inherently better than another. I know enough to know that assumptions I learned from cultural tutors can be wrong, and that there's so much I don't know.\\n\\n[Source](https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cjf36x/woman_who_accused_indian_politician_of_rape_hit/evdfxdz/)\",\n",

       "  'I agree.  But to give them an individual with their own identity would mean to respect their drives/needs - and thus their freedom to operate on their own, which is something Indian society has trouble with.  I don\\'t know if you know about astrology or believe it, but I\\'ll note it because I think it highlights something relevant.  \\n\\nThe planet Mars (Mangala) represents the primal drives/needs, particularly of the physical body - i.e. hunger, sex drive, adrenal systems, etc. To note something\\'s own basic needs is to accept its individuality and see it as a unique and living being.  Mars is also representative of the male and masculine energy.  So to accept a woman as an individual, we would have to accept her \\'masculine\\' side as well; as the Yin-Yang of Chinese culture states, both the masculine and feminine polarities have a small bit of each in the other.  So a man has some feminine qualities, and a woman also has some masculine qualities.  Each person needs these in balance to have a balanced and functional psyche.  But Indians have a hard time doing that, and instead objectify women. Why?\\n\\nMy theory is that it has its roots in the \\'collectivist\\' identity that Indians (actually, most Asians in general) have.  Westerners, in contrast, often see themselves as individuals first and in a collective sense second.  So an American, John Thompson may meet another American, Jack Jones, and have little idea of what to expect from each other in terms of his innate ideals and lifestyle.  But an Indian, Ram Kapoor may meet another Abhinav Reddy and even if they don\\'t know each other, they have some instinctive idea that the other knows about what it means to be \"Indian\" and what their basic values are.  They tend to identify each other as Indian first, individuals second.  And when you have that \\'\\'collective\" mindset first, you feel that at some basic level, others \"are\" you - they aren\\'t that different from you.  So their needs \"are\" your needs and vice versa. But since we live in a relative world with limited needs and resources, how is an individual to look after oneself if everyone else is \\'the same\\' as them?  They start to create artificial differences and separation externally (instead of internally like Western societies), so they can establish some kind of social \\'pecking order\\' and create a sense of interpersonal order.\\n\\nSince the Male energy (Mars) is naturally assertive and outgoing, it tends to be the one that grasps at external resources first and seeks outer power, and so it is the one that sets the artificial differences for that reason.  External resources, and the need to control them, is represented by Saturn (Shani) - which symbolizes authority, social power, control, hard work, the bone structure, etc.  So it tends to be the male energy that seeks to set social rules that individuals in a collective society are expected to follow and innately understand.  One example of this is the caste system; once you can identify someone\\'s caste based on their surname, you can determine whether they are a threat to you or not and thus how to treat them.  Another is work position and career - if your job is high-ranking, socially you are worthy of more respect.  A third is skin-color; if you are fairer-skinned, you may feel subconsciously worth more than darker people.  And finally, a fourth is gender: males, being more assertive and externally controlling, may naturally feel more in-charge than women and thus will see them as \\'subservient\\' to them, and seek to relegate them to positions (such as homemaking, domestic duties) that they cannot easily move beyond.  \\n\\nNow, because individuals in \"collectivist-first\" societies see other people as being \"the same\" as themselves and need to create artificial external differences to protect their own needs and resources, those differences are often easily used to objectify the other person.  So a light-skinned person may automatically be subconsciously seen as \\'worth more\\' even if they have a worse personality or lower caste than a darker person (appearance is often more instinctive than a social boundary).  A lower-caste person will be rejected and cast aside by a higher-caste person (assuming these people are both caste-conscious).  And a woman, no matter if she is just as confident or capable as a male, will more easily be objectified as \\'subservient\\' to a man.  Note that since the male energy sets the social standard, it is less likely to objectify another male except in a social sense; but since women are also man\\'s sexual counterpart, women have to deal with both social objectification, as well as sexual objectification.  \\n\\nSince the sexual energy is very powerful, it is also very easy to misuse it if not deal with wisely; a human seen as socially-inferior yet naturally attractive and as a submissive \\'object\\' is very easily degraded -sometimes to a dangerous level - by those in charge who are not mentally/emotionally mature.  So to combat this, an alternate route would be to elevate women to a high status, yet because she is objectified, she is still \\'unnattainable\\' to men - by seeing her just as a mother or sister you remove sexual objectification, and as just a goddess, you remove her social objectification - yet in either case, because you remove her individual needs, you still dehumanize her in a way and don\\'t see her as an equal, and thus you cannot enjoy her company (nor she yours) - socially, protectively, romantically, sexually, or otherwise, in a humane way.\\n\\nPerhaps the way to go about changing this, in such a \\'collective-minded\\' society would be to focus on seeing people more as individuals first and to pay less attention on artificial barriers like caste, skin color, gender, etc.  Of course, perhaps those deeply-ingrained ways of life may not go away entirely, maybe not for some generations hence, but it has to start somewhere anyway.  Maybe the greatest (and most disruptive) thing that happened to the country is the internet and smartphone (specifically, making it available to everyone).   Now, everyone can access Youtube and get influence from all other cultures across the globe, and can Tweet their opinions on everything and anything they want.  Probably for the first time, the common person in India finally has a voice and can influence the power structure all the way to the very top.  If an actor, politician or some social bully does something wrong, a lowly person can still tweet - and enough of these can empower the masses to bring dangerous consequences (getting kick out of leadership or fired) to the powerful.  This is probably most easily seen in the recent #MeToo movement for sexual crimes - a positive is that even if the powerful and accused weren\\'t prosecuted, socially they were somewhat ostracized and had a tougher time bouncing back than they ordinarily would.   So the internet is a \\'great leveler\\' for a society like India, and yet its disruptive, \\'information-at-your-fingertips\\' ability means Indians have more things (that were previously hidden) open to their eyes now - they are seeing how other Indians really feel about issues (especially those of other religions), and anonymity makes them feel bolder.  Thus, those who feel their status quo and society is threatened, feel the need to fight back against all this disruptive change - so you see the RSS and other militant groups on the rise.  \\n\\nBut if the future looks uncertain, we should still try our best to see the humanity in each other and treat each other like individuals, and respect outer differences as much as possible without getting needlessly riled up.  Perhaps if we all learned how to be calmer and look at things more objectively - or commit to some exercise, yoga or spiritual practice - we might be able to interact with each other better interpersonally, and might make us open to new possibilities for the country.',\n",

       "  'I spent my kindergarten years till standard III in Germany. I nearly failed my Grade IV here in India due to the differences in teaching methods. \\n\\nI loved the education at Germany — they teach basics very very clearly and you don\\'t have any pressure in performing well. Every subject is loaded with fun activities, excursions and even theatre trips for subjects such as history and German. My school had qualified teachers — most of them have to have at least a Master degree in education and another in the subject to teach in Government schools. Some had PhDs.\\n\\nWe even had a tortoise and aquatic exhibit in the school! — note that my school was a government one in a relatively small town. Government schools are top notch in Germany. I miss those days.\\n\\nWe were taught the number system from 0 to 10 in Grade I, 0-100 in Grade II and 0-1000 (and multiples of 1000 — 10k, 1 Million etc ) in Grade III. When I started Grade IV in India I suddenly find teachers asking multiplication tables of 21, 17 etc which I had no clue. \\n\\nIt seriously took me months to get what the hell was 4 **za** 3 = 12. Apparently it\\'s four three**\\'s are** 12. The \\'**s are**\\' has become **za**.\\n\\nThe Indian education system continues to run in a monotonous way, “training” students to excel in exam. Sure, there exists exceptions but the majority sits right in the midst of exploiting the fear of children.\\n\\nI vividly remember that in Grade II we had something called multiplication knock-off every week (loose translation) in the German schools. Students are paired in two and form a line. The teacher asks multiplication tables from 1 to 10 and whoever says the answer quickly advances to the next round and finally the kid who is the winner ( so basically a loose recursive binary search algorithm) gets a star sticker and a prize — chocolate, toy etc. It was really fun!  We also went to a car driving school around 20-30kms from the school to learn about road safety symbols and drove go karts with an instructor — at Grade III! Germany has a real passion for motorsports — I can tell you. \\n\\nIn India — personally I found — teachers are abusive, kids get slapped for not understand a math problem, morning assembly has routine nail and shoe (polish) checks, you need to kneel if you forgot your english assignment book II or III?, the course is huge and not systematic, peer pressure and especially the bullying — isolating kids which have low grades, tuitions from grade II, memorizing most of the answers for \"marks\" and everything in the system is tuned to sing the song of excellent grades to boast.\\n\\nYou might counter me that international high standard schools are better but this drifts into a complex question whether quality education should come at a price or should be free?\\n\\nIn the Indian education system the intellect of the student is taxed to the maximum whereas the other side of the coin - the non-intellective skills like empathy, motivation, discipline, self-awareness is entirely neglected. \\n\\nDuring my undergrad my final project was on elementary education in India and how to improve them using AR and other interactive methods (AR video game neurotherapy for attention deficit disorder) — the results we got were shocking. \\n\\nIn simple words: \\nWe visited many schools and we found that children are humiliated every day and live in constant stress between those infinite exams and assignments. Nobody has taught them how to love knowledge, and we felt that only thing that holds them in the classroom is fear. \\n\\n*Sniff.*',\n",

The classes you could take had a more holistic approach to it and whatever you found yourself interested in, you were encouraged to keep going forward and improving it. That way you were more and more capable of being able to use that skill for the future if necessary. It felt very personal, like I was learning things out of my own volition. Coming back to India for my 11th and 12th, everything felt standardized. Everyone basically had to go through the same thing more or less, there felt less emphasis on discussion and analysis but more on memorizing materials and just getting the good marks. It wasn't like IB system had an emphasis on marks/credits either, but it felt part and parcel with the learning process to a degree. The more you were into the subject, you naturally got more marks. Back here, it felt I really had to drag myself for the marks, not for the learning. My geography classes were the toughest.

Srinivas, the electrician, made the cop talk to his boss, Junior Engineer at the sub-station to pardon him but he didn’t listen and issued the challan instead. The furious electrician later disconnected the power supply to the police station stating that the cops haven’t paid Rs 6.62 Lakh electricity bill.\\n\\n> Taking the side of the electrician, DVVNL Sub Divisional officer Ranveer Singh said they have issued several reminders to the police station for pending bills and after realizing they haven’t paid a single buck since 2016, the office decided to cut the power supply.

It all depends on making decisions that are in line with your values, how you are able to navigate parents who don\\'t share your lifestyle,  and accepting that whatever decision you make, there are going to pros and cons.',\n",

       "  \"\\nWatched The Lion King yesterday night with a female friend. There has never been any flirting or anything romantic between us. Always been platonic. Not even hugs. The only body contact has been shake-hands and pokes on the shoulders. We go for movies once a month or so. Sometimes other friends join. Anyway, as usual after the movie, we decided to go our own ways to our places. I usually wait for her cab to arrive before I leave. Due to the Friday night traffic, the cabs were quite expensive and so I offered to drop her at her place. Dropped her outside her apartment. Told her I wouldn't leave until I saw her go up into her room and wave goodbye to me from the window. We talk for a while on the road as well and it was breezy and cold. Now, the last time I took a piss was during the break in the movie and I had lots of water. I had been holding it in for about two hours now and my place was at least an hour away, due to the traffic. She asks me to use the bathroom in her place. So, we go to her place.   \\n  \\n  \\nAfter pissing for what felt like 5 minutes I was relieved. I think I even had tears in my eyes. She offers me some food she had prepared but I reject it saying I had to get back. She said the traffic was still bad. Also that I had never tried anything she prepared but always makes fun of her cooking skills. All the things were true and I had no comebacks or ways to avoid. I was kinda hungry as well. She had made pasta and it was actually good. It wasn't anything spectacular, but pretty good for someone who wasn't a professional chef. Ended up complimenting her and she was happy.  It was probably the first time I had complimented her on her face. We kept talking for a while and watched something on Netflix and it was past midnight. I was yawning frequently and she said it wasn't a good idea for me to ride when I'm this sleepy. I said I would manage and that there was no other option anyway as she had only one bed. She seemed concerned and convinced me to stay by saying that she'd stay awake or sleep on the floor and things like that.     \\n\\nEventually I agreed to spend the night there itself. She was also getting sleepy and decided to join in the same bed.  Although she lived alone, she hails from a conservative family/background and as far as I knew, she was someone who'd have-sex-only-after-marriage kind. I wasn't thinking of anything but said 'hmmm' for fun and she asked not to get any ideas and brought out a pillow from nowhere and said there'll be the 'friendship barrier' between us. Random banter continued, we kept talking for a long time and after some time the barrier was breached and we started making out. The foreplay went on for a while and clothes started to come off. I was in just my boxers and she was in her innerwear. It looked very much like we'd go all the way. There was lots of touching and fondling and what not. She started exploring my upper body with her fingers and turns out I was quite sensitive/ticklish to touch. She found it amusing and 'cute' and started giggling and *then* spent the next half an hour or so teasing (not verbally) and tickling me. The boner had long gone. At some point I realized that I had been cockblocked by very person who was about to have sex with me. The mood had certainly changed. Both of us were exhausted. She from her giggling and the movement attempts to tickle and me with being tickled and the light laughter and the holding of breath that goes along with it. We spent the night cuddling. It was nice.  \\n\\nWhen I woke up, she was already up and had even showered and got ready as if she wanted to go somewhere. I'm terribly bad at reading signals but it felt like she wanted me to leave. Confirmed it when she said had to meet some friend and asked me about my plans. I said I had no plans and that I'll go home, have breakfast and sleep till evening. We talked for a bit more. Neither of us mentioned anything about the previous night. And it felt like the 'friendship barrier' was back in place. The goodbye was only a shake hand.   \\n  \\nWe did text each other a few times today, but talked nothing about the night. There's no awkwardness from the way we talked and I hope it doesn't get awkward. She wasn't really someone I had fancied until I got into bed with her, but still I get the feeling of a lost/wasted opportunity.\",\n",

The investors(specially the risk averse ones) lost faith in the other creditors and thus seeked to invest only in Government backed intruments. This drove yeilds down very sharply and negative in many cases. \\n\\nFurthermore, the governments and reserve banks in these developed nations also began to cut down repo and interest rates in order to discourage investors from investing in government securities. Their rationale was to drive the money into the private markets, so as to inject capital into the stressed markets and \\nhopefully revive them.

Bring exchange rates into the picture, and you'll find that our interest rates are fairly similar to comparable countries (you can compare across countries with similar credit ratings / CDS spreads as we do).\\n\\nAlso like someone pointed - Yield to Maturity and Coupon aren't same, they're equal at the time of inception of the bond.
